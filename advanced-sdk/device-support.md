# Device Support

Several options are available to provide NDI support to systems or hardware devices integrating the NDI Advanced SDK.

The NDI Advanced SDK includes details to allow NDI to be compressed on smaller FPGA designs or, since version 4, to leverage existing H.265, H.264, and AAC encoders already on a device by simply updating its firmware to support specific requirements (this approach lets you quickly and easily add NDI support to _existing_ products).
