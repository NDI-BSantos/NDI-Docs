# Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
This documentation refers to the [**Unreal Engine SDK**](https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-unreal-engine-sdk/), a separate SDK that adds full IP video and audio support within Unreal Engine 5.3, unlocking real-time 3D, AR, and VR content creation. If you want to learn more about the complete NDI SDK, check the online [documentation](../sdk/introduction.md) and download it [here](https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/).
{% endhint %}

This documentation is paramount for developers and integrators seeking to combine the potential of NDI technology with the creative possibilities of [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/pt-BR), a powerful 3D creation software.

This documentation is continuously updated to match the most recent version of our Unreal SDK. Currently, we are offering **version 3.5**. You can check the most meaningful updates in our [change log](release-notes.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Read our [**White Paper**](broken-reference) if you'd like to know more about the vision of NDI and our technology's fundamental features, protocols, and settings.
